This is a cross assembler for the LINC computer, compatible with Mary
Allen Wilke's LAP6.

The original LAP6 was more than just an assembler; it was also a text
editor and file system for magnetic tapes.  It was essentially an
integrated development environment and operating system for the LINC.
It managed all this with only 1024 instructions in memory at a time.
